Students should propose their own project. In exceptional cases the professors may offer a list of projects to students. The responsible professor has to approve the student proposal. The project will include the following elements: \n"," 1- An initial definition of the goals of the project, technology used and expected results\n"," 2- Use of any of the data collection studied to retrieve information from some popular online service or social network.\n","3- Data analysis using up to date technological frameworks (for instance python, R, etc).\n","4- Results visualization.\n","\n","The students will defend their project in a public exposition to the rest of students at the end of the semester. \n","\n","There will be a number of lab classes that will be used to supervise the evolution of the project and to allow students progressing in its development.\n","\n","OFFICE HOURS: The students will get access to meetings with professors every week individually or collectively in order to clarify theorical and/or practical concepts.
